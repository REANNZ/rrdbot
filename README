This is a fork of RRDBot.

Original version can be found here:
http://thewalter.net/stef/software/rrdbot/

It's name notwithstanding, this version does NOT create RRD files nor
depend on the rrdtool suite.

Rather, it writes raw counter values to a plain text file. This output
file can be safely written to by multiple rrdbot instances.

It also contains minor bug fixes and enhancements to RRDBot, made
by REANNZ and others.
