.Os rrdbot 
.Sh NAME
.Nm rddbot-get
.Nd retrieves an SNMP value from an SNMP uri
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl Mnr
.Op Fl m Ar mibdir
.Op Fl s Ar srcaddr
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Ar snmp://community@host/oid
.Nm 
.Fl V
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
retrieves an SNMP value from an SNMP URI. The format is the same as is used by 
.Xr rrdbotd 8 .
You can use 
.Nm 
for testing SNMP polling while configuring 
.Xr rrdbotd 8 .
.Sh OPTIONS
The options are as follows. 
.Bl -tag -width Fl
.It Fl m Ar mibdir
The directory in which to look for MIB files. The default directory is 
usually sufficient.
.It Fl M
Display MIB parsing warnings.
.It Fl n 
Display numeric OIDs.
.It Fl r
Recursively walk the SNMP values under the given OID.
.It Fl s Ar srcaddr
Source address to send SNMP packets from.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
The amount of time (in seconds) to wait for an SNMP response. Defaults to 
5 seconds.
.It Fl V
Prints the version of
.Nm
and the locations of the configuration files, RRD files etc.
.El
.Sh MULTIPLE AGENTS
.Nm
supports failover between multiple agents. If an SNMP query fails on one agent
or a value is not found when querying an agent, then it will switch to another
configured agent. 
.Pp
When combined with a query (see TABLE QUERIES) you can use this feature to 
search for a given value in a table on one of multiple agents.
.Pp
To use failover, simply use multiple host names with commas (without a space)
separating them. For example:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snmp://public@two.example.com,one.example.com/sysUptime.0
.Ed
.Sh TABLE QUERIES
.Nm 
can query a value that corresponds to a certain row in an SNMP table. On 
many SNMP agents the indexes of rows in tables are not fixed, and this 
allows you to retrieve a certain value no matter what row of the table 
it is on.
.Pp
Add the OID and value you want to search for in the table to the end 
of the SNMP URL. Only one query value is supported. 
.Pp
For example to get the outbound packet count on the 'eth0' interface, you would use:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
snmp://public@example.com/ifInUcastPkts?ifDescr=eth0
